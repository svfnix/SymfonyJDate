Symfony Bundle for converting dates from Gregorian calendar system to Jalali calendar system and vice versa. Supports dates beyond 2038.  
Jalali, also known as Shamsi or Hijri Shamsi is the Iranian calendar system. It uses [Salar Kaboli's jDateTime class](https://github.com/sallar/jDateTime) for the conversion. 

#Requirements

jDateTime Requires **PHP >= 5.2**  

#Installation

```
composer require svfnix/symfonyjdate
```
And then add the package to app/AppKernel.php

#Examples

There is two ways to use this bundle:

##1. As a Twig filter (recommended)

Simply you can filter any variable containing a date, datetime, interval or date string:
```
{{ entity.date|jdate }}
```

Also it's possible to chose the format:
```
{{ entity.date|jdate('Y-m-d') }}
```

##2. As a service

Not recommanded, Maybe neccessary in some situations though.

Example:
```
$jDate = $serviceContainer->get('symfony_persia.jdate');
```
